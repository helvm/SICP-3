# SICP  
Short for the wizard book < Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs >  
For better reading experience, you can find html version here:  
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#SEC_Contents)  
Here is the place I keep and display my [practices](https://github.com/soulomoon/SICP) for SICP  

## Credit and resources
* [Chinese Translation related](https://github.com/DeathKing/Learning-SICP)


## Environment
Most of the practice done here is tested with drracket 
* meta header `#lang planet neil/sicp`,  
* some with `#lang racket` or `#lang sicp`,  
* if without `#lang` line, I am setting the language to SICP in the left corner (it only shows up if you have ran `#lang planet neil/sicp` before).
